PP reclaim evaluation noted some missing pages which have been added to project.

However, final map should be coloured (see https://archive.org/details/dli.granth.77827/page/413/mode/2up).
Version with project doesn't show sufficient detail and needs to be replaced but no online versions
are of sufficient quality either.

<b>Proofing</b>
</p>
<p>
There are no deviations from the Guidelines.
</p>
<p>
This book is mostly in English, but pages 28-29 are in Dutch and 271-274 are in German. There is some Greek on page 17, and a few Indonesian words used throughout the book. I have added the most common of the Indonesian words to the project good words list. But don't worry, it's <i>mostly</i> in English.
</p>
<p>
There is a diaresis (two dots) above the i in "Sa√Ødjah".
</p>
<p>
I have reduced the resolution of the scans, to make them load faster. If something is hard to read, and you would like to see it in higher resolution, the original scans are available from Google and The Internet Archive.

<b>Post-Processing</b>
</p>
<p>
Google didn't scan the fold-out maps, but I have scanned them and placed them in the project directory. The map of the Indian Archipelago is black and white line art with a single spot colour (brown, basically) used to shade Dutch territories. Due to the limitations of the scanner used by the Rare Books department, this has been scanned greyscale.
